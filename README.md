### Project Overview
The PowerBI dashboard provides a comprehensive view of the patient waitlist at the hospital, featuring various visualizations based on key criteria. These include a pie chart illustrating the distribution of case types (inpatient, outpatient, or day case), a stacked column chart showing wait times categorized by age group, and a list highlighting the top 5 specialties with the longest wait times. Additionally, line charts track the total cases over time, with separate lines for each case type and a specific line for outpatient cases. Users can filter the data by date, case type, and specialty to tailor their analysis.

### Data Sources
The primary dataset used for this analysis is in the combined .csv files found in the "data" folder. This dataset contains info about the patient waitlist, including date, speciality, waittime, and age group.
